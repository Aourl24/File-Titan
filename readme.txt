Title
File Titan

Description
File titan is an application used for managing and editing files.we can create ,store ,download and edit files with file titan.It function like  text editor with some additional and amazing features.
It is build with django(for backend),html and css(frontend) ,htmx(handling ajax request),react(text editor interface),javascript(interactive).

I always code with different system,sometimes on my mobile phone or my laptop but i realized that i have to move my code from one system to the other in order to do this, then i have to solve this problems:

1- How to i edit a file on one system and do not have to worry about moving it to another system.
2- How do i merge files from two different systems
3- How do i get ready made file without having to worry about creating it on both system

the solutions i suggested:

1- I will need a application that bridge a gap between my two system
2- I will need a text editor to create and edit my files at once
3- The application i created most be able to merge to files together
4- I will need a way to edit a file without affecting the original copy of that file

This is how File titan was created.

How to run
The application is a web application, so to run you have to visit the site.You can run code on the site, but to create or edit files you have to create account. The reason for you to create acccount is to keep track of file owner

How to Use
Creating a Directory
When you log in to the account, you can create a directory by clicking the create directory link, This is will create a directory for you to store a files.Creating a directory ensure proper organizations of files, The amazing thing of creating a directory on the site is that the directory can be download as zip file with the exact same path you created on the file.
Creating a File
on your directory click the file icon to create a file, you will be redirect to text editor after creating a file.If the file is a python file i.e ends with the python extension, you can run the code. Support for running other extension is not permitted, one of the features we will like to improve

Branch
Creating a Branch
a branch is a copy of a file which have been seperated idependently from the file.when you create a branch of a file on the site, it means you created a copy of that particular file.after creating a branch you can edit the file but the save will not reflect on the original file until the owner of the original file take an action on the file
Merging a Branch
when you merge a branch with the original file, it will compare the code from the two files and sorted them according to form a whole file.merging wil overide the original file to form a new file.merging can only be done by the owner of the original file
Replacing a File with Branch
Replacing means the file has been entirely replaced by branch. This can only be the done by the owner of the original file

Cloning
Clone file is different from a branch because , a clone file is a copy of the file but it is not independent from the file.It is like both the original file and clone file reference to the same file but the owner is changed.Clone file are identify on the site by seeing the 'clone' word in the front of the file.This means the file is a clone of the orignal file.

Downloading
You can download a file from the site

Running Your Python File
You can run your python code on the site
Note: the idle does not support input on the site, this make cause the site to slow down

TextEditor
The text editor on the site is a simple text editor, the import file button helps you to import file from your local system to the text editor, that was cool right, yeah it is.  


Contribution
Anybody could contribute to the application but contributors should be careful because their are some dirty work done inside the project, i was just kidding.
